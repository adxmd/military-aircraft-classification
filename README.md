# Military Aircraft Image Classification  
**COMP 4107 - Neural Networks Final Project**  
**Author:** Adam David  


---

## Overview
The goal of this project is to classify images of military aircraft into 80 distinct classes using deep learning. I leverage CNN-based architectures such as EfficientNetB3, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2 as base models due to their high accuracy and efficiency when pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. I will be using the dataset from Kaggle's *Military Aircraft Detection Dataset*, and all models are built using Tensorflow/Keras.
<!--
Due to hardware limitations (no access to a GPU), the object detection component was not implemented, but future work is planned to incorporate YOLO or EfficientDet for localization.
