# Military Aircraft Image Classification  
**COMP 4107 - Neural Networks Final Project**  
**Author:** [Adam David](https://www.adamdavid.dev)  


---

## Overview
The goal of this project is to classify images of military aircraft into 80 distinct classes using deep learning. This project leverages CNN-based architectures such as EfficientNetB3, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2 as base models due to their high accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. This project uses the dataset from Kaggle's *Military Aircraft Detection Dataset*, and all models are built using Tensorflow/Keras. The models are trained both with the base models as frozen feature extractors and while the base models are fully trainable. 
<!--
Due to hardware limitations (no access to a GPU), the object detection component was not implemented, but future work is planned to incorporate YOLO or EfficientDet for localization.

**Notes:**
- We can see improvements in model performance if trained for longer
- ResNet50 performed the best when used as a frozen feature extractor, probably due to its residual connections and balanced depth.
- MobileNetV2 is too lightweight to extract enough features when frozen, hence its low accuracy
- InceptionResNetV2's lack of accuracy when frozen proves that it is too complex, with more than double the parameters of any other model here
- Increasing the batch size increased accuracy and lowered categorical cross-entropy loss across most models

## âš  Limitations
- CPU-only training significantly increased runtime and limited hyperparameter exploration.
- Object detection was not implemented due to the lack of CUDA support.
- Very small input images suffered heavily from information loss during resizing.

---

## Future Work
- Implement object detection using YOLO, EfficientDet, or Faster R-CNN.
- Use GPU-accelerated training to fine-tune full models and explore more hyperparameters.
